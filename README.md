# cutefishos-overlay

The Project is my hobby.

I will try my best port CutefishOS to Gentoo.

If you like it, you could give me a hand.

You could try those commands below on your Gentoo install to enable this overlay.

`emerge -av eselect-repository`

`eselect repository add cutefishos git https://github.com/HougeLangley/cutefishos-overlay.git`

Thanks.
